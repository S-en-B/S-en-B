## about me
I am a college student studying computer science. I've always had an interest in computers. That passion has evolved into a love for software engineering and gamedev. 

## Classes I'm taking currently or have taken
- Java
- Intro to C
- Data structures and Algorithms
- Networks 1

## Languages I know
- java (bit rusty)
- c (current love)
- bash (only a little)

## Operating Systems
- Apple: I'm a bit of a nut, grew up on their stuff, only downside is price
- Linux: my side hoe, love the flexibility of it, hate that its not used more widely by the average joe
- Windows: Due to school I can use Windows well, but I **despise** Windows with a passion

## Fun facts
- I still have a working 3rd generation iPod Touch that I saved for when it came out
- First computer was a Lenovo Ideapad (slower than a drunk snail)
- Current computer is a Macbook Air
