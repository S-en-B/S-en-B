## About me
I am a college student studying computer science with an emphasis on software engineering. Growing up, I've always had an interest in computers. That passion has evolved into a love for software engineering and gamedev. 

## Current projects
Working on a sequel to my first Orc Dungeon game. I'm using C++ instead of C to add more features.
